# Camera LCD
This is a highly experimental plugin that seeks to add camera views to lcd screens in Space Engineers. To use, set the LCD to `Script` mode and then select `Camera Display` in the list. You must also put the name of the camera in the LCD or cockpit `Custom Data`. To specify a specific screen, use `[Index]:[CameraName]` example: `1:Camera`. The index starts at 0, so the second display in the list is index 1. To adjust settings of the plugin, use `/cameralcd` in chat open the settings menu. 
This plugin is still a WIP.
